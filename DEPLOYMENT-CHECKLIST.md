- [ ] Set reminder to follow up if needed
- [ ] Keep the worker running and functional

## Emergency Troubleshooting

If something breaks after deployment:

1. **Check Cloudflare Dashboard** for errors
2. **Review Worker Logs**: `npx wrangler tail`
3. **Verify Bindings**: Check wrangler.jsonc
4. **Test Locally**: `npm start` and reproduce issue
5. **Rollback if Needed**: `npx wrangler rollback`

### Quick Fixes

**Bot not responding**:
```bash
npx wrangler tail # Check logs
```

**RAG not working**:
```bash
npx wrangler vectorize list # Check index
# Re-ingest if needed
curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/admin/ingest -d @my-documents.json
```

**Session issues**:
- Clear browser cookies
