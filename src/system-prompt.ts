COVER LETTER:
I'm a product-minded Software Engineer with a strong grounding in algorithms, data engineering, and systems design. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Amsterdam to deepen my understanding in Distributed Systems and Parallel Computing. Looking forward, I aim to deepen my skills through an industry internship at a company operating at the forefront of this field. Given its mission to make the internet faster, more reliable, and more secure for millions of users worldwide, I can not think of a better place to do so than at Cloudflare.

In my past roles I have worked on data pipelines and large-scale systems where reliability and scalability were essential. I have contributed to Apple's AI/ML department, where I achieved a tenfold speedup in a daily data export pipeline, worked as a rocket data engineer in New Zealand, and most recently took the lead on platform quality at a Y Combinator startup to ensure the scalability of their product. What excites me most is building software systems that are well thought out and truly robust.

Cloudflare offers exactly the kind of challenges I want to take on: building and maintaining systems that operate at global scale while staying fast and dependable. The opportunity to work on infrastructure that handles massive internet traffic, and to contribute to technologies like Cloudflare Workers and its distributed edge platform, is one I would be eager to take on.

I am very excited by the prospect of joining the Lisbon intern cohort in the summer of 2026.
